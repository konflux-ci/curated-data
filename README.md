# curated-data

This is a fork of [clearlydefined/curated-data](https://github.com/clearlydefined/curated-data) which we set up as a place where [konflux-ci people interested in licenses](https://github.com/orgs/konflux-ci/teams/license-people) can manage license declarations that we aim to contribute back to clearlydefined.

You are currently looking at the [configuration](https://github.com/konflux-ci/curated-data/tree/configuration) branch, where this README exists and some [github actions](https://github.com/konflux-ci/curated-data/tree/configuration/.github/workflows/) for syncing our fork with upstream.

Notably, we are syncing [clearlydefined/curated-data](https://github.com/clearlydefined/curated-data) to the [upstream](https://github.com/konflux-ci/curated-data/tree/upstream) branch on this fork.
